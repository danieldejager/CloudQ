Abstract. 
Cloud Providers are at times unaware of the risks brought into the cloud by their clients. They might be hosting software on the cloud that was not subject to rigorous
Information Assurance practice as a result of lacking information security governance maturity. In most cases, cloud providers contractually bind clients with agreements in
order to prevent risks to be realised on the upper layers of the cloud stack. However, without data collection points and analysis of the risks on both sides of the coin, 
there will not be a consolidated view of risks. This paper presents an online web-based risk analysis tool in order to provide a holistic view of risks “above” the cloud
and “below” the cloud. The inspiration for this tool came about from SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud being implemented on the Cloud locally in South-Africa and discussions with
Cloud Provider Risk Managers based in Ashburn, Virginia. The software was written with the Facilitated Risk Analysis and Assessment Process in mind. The input to the tool 
follows a facilitated process of risk identification and control selection. The software then can calculates the Risk Rating for each identified risk and is able to
visually articulate the business attributes based on integrity, availability and confidentiality, as well as above and below the cloud, and lastly provide a holistic
calculation of the entire stack i.e. per instance quantitavely and for all SAP Sites qualitatively.
